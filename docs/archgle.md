# Archgle

**A customized Arch Linux distribution with Google services and AI at its core.**

## Vision

Archgle is more than just another Arch-based distribution - it's a reimagining of what a modern Linux system can be when deeply integrated with Google's ecosystem and powered by AI. From kernel-level AI monitoring to seamless Google Drive mounting, Archgle brings the power of cloud services and artificial intelligence directly into your operating system.

## Core Philosophy

### Google First
Unlike other distributions where cloud services are an afterthought, Archgle treats Google integration as a first-class citizen:
- **Automatic Google Drive mounting** on login
- **Native Gmail, Calendar, and Contacts** sync
- **Google Chrome** with automatic profile sync
- **Gemini API** integration for AI capabilities
- **Google Cloud SDK** pre-configured

### Agentic AI Integration
Archgle features deep AI integration at the system level:
- **AI Daemon** - A systemd service that provides system-level AI capabilities
- **Kernel Hooks** - Monitor system events and performance in real-time
- **AI CLI** - Ask your computer questions, get AI-assisted troubleshooting
- **Automation** - Let AI manage routine system tasks

### Hardware-Aware
Archgle automatically detects your hardware and optimizes accordingly:
- **High-end systems**: Maximum performance, no compromises
- **Mid-range systems**: Balanced performance and efficiency
- **Low-end systems**: Optimized for efficiency without sacrificing usability
- **GPU Support**: AMD, Intel, Nvidia graphics acceleration
- **NPU Support**: Neural Processing Unit acceleration for AI tasks

### Beautiful by Default
